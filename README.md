# 💬 Simple Chatbot (HTML, CSS, JS)

A beginner-friendly chatbot built with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This chatbot doesn’t use any backend or AI model — it replies with predefined responses, making it easy to understand how chat interfaces work.

---

## Features
- Clean **dark mode UI** 🌓  
- User & bot styled messages  
- Works with **Enter key** or Send button  
- Predefined replies for common inputs (hello, hi, bye, how are you, etc.)  
- 100% front-end only — no backend required
